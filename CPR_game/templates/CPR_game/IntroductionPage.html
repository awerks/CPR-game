        <h2><i class="fas fa-welcome-sign"></i> Welcome to our Common-Pool Resource (CPR) Game Experiment</h2>
        <p>In this experiment, we'll use the context of climate change and Earth's atmosphere to simulate Common-Pool
            Resource (CPR) scenarios. You, as a participant, are about to embark on a journey where your actions can
            have a significant impact on the environment.</p>

        <p>Over a total of 20 rounds, you and your fellow teammates will represent the Earth's inhabitants seeking to
            balance your own profit with the sustainable management of Earth's atmospheric resources. Our game closely
            mimics the real world problem of CO2 emissions. In every round, you can spend points from your fixed budget
            to conduct activities, each of which results in CO2 emissions. Every point you spend emits 1t of CO2.</p>

        <p>At the same time, you will receive a return of 1.4 times your spent points plus the remaining unused points
            as your individual profit. However, be mindful that the Earth's atmosphere can only absorb 100t of CO2 after
            each round.</p>

        <p>The crucial aspect to remember here is that the more CO2 emissions exceed 1000t, the lower the profit rate
            for everyone becomes in the following round.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-tasks"></i> Experiment Conditions</h2>
        <p>This experiment has two main variables: <strong>Heterogeneity</strong> and <strong>Delayed
                Consequences</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Heterogeneity:</strong> Each participant will play two games. In the first, all players receive an
            equal budget (50 points per round). In the second game, players will be given unequal budgets (30 or 70
            points) within the same group.</p>

        <p><strong>Delayed Consequences:</strong> Half the teams will receive immediate feedback on their resource use
            and profit consequences after each round, while the other half will only receive feedback after rounds 4, 8,
            12, 16, and 20.</p>
